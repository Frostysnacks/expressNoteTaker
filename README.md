# expressNoteTaker

## Description
This application was designed with a small business owner in mind. It allows you to create and save notes in a quick easy way, they can also be deleted.
This application was build by using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and express. It is also hosted live by Heroku. The most difficult challenge for me with this project was finding a way to delete.


## Installation
run the "npm install" command and then install express using "npm i express" in the terminal

## Usage
Click the Get started button and then add a title and content to your notes! You can then save you notes youing the save icon in the top right of the screen.
You can also delete saved notes by clicking on the trash can icon!
